# VenueShareProject
This is a web application project for a venue sharing company. You can view the website (application) through this link http://venuesharedev.azurewebsites.net/default.aspx

The project simply allow the following features:
1. User can create an account, and login. All the passwords are encrypted by hashing algorithm.
2. Users can Submit a venue to share with other users if required. Moreover, they can view, search and apply for renting a venue.
3. Admin can create a user, venue, add another admin, approve venues, reject venues, delete venues, or even promote venues.
4. Error pages (404 and 403) are applied.

Hopefully you will enjoy going through my simple project.
