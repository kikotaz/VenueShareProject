                    We are professional event managers, and we started our business back in 2012
                    with experience more than 7 years in the market now. VenueShare noticed that
                    there are lots of customers who struggle to find a good venue for their events.
                    We also found that there are lots of people who are willing to share their
                    properties for events. So why not make life easy for everyone?

                <span>
                    We simply work as a meeting point between both venue owners, and 
                    events owners who wish to hold events. We created a meeting point
                    where both can search for each other. At the same time, we can offer
                    our services to manage the events for both parties. We take care of 
                    everything including licensing, permits, dealing with vendors, and 
                    anything related to the event. It is an end-to-end service for 
                    event management.

                <span>
                    It is simple, venue owners post their venues, and we contact them
                    to discuss some details, before approving their venues. Once approved,
                    it will be listed on our website for everyone to find them.

                <br />
                <span>
                    Once an event owner find a good venue for their event, they just need
                    to propose, and our team check proposals daily, and negotiate all fees,
                    and T&Cs with both the venue owners, and event owners.
